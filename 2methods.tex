This chapter elaborates the used research and analysis methods, presents interview themes and structures, and evaluates the research. 

\subsection{Initial Research}
This research aims to understand the requirements from multiple companies towards common data standards. The research began with reviewing relevant literature on data governance, sharing inter-enterprise data, knowledge sharing and institutional theory. The literature review was conducted by keywoard search in scientific databases, and citations backwards and forwards were used within relevant literature. In all disciplines the scope was kept on general level. This initial literature review formed the basis for the interview themes.

\subsection{Interview Themes}
The interview is a semi-structured thematic interview \cite{hirsjarvi2000tutkimushaastattelu} with a standardized set of open-ended questions, which allows deep exploration of studied objects \cite{patton2002qualitative}. The interviews are performed once per interviewee, with one to two interviewees per participating company. The interview themes are presented in the appendices.

The interview themes were formulated by the researcher based on findings of the initial literature research. The interviews aimed to understand the requirements and capabilities of the organizations in multiple different areas. The interview themes included the following themes for following reasons:

\begin{itemize}  
\item \textit{Background information} of the interviewee and the organization to position the answers and analysis.
\item \textit{Institutional barriers}: to understand the regulative, normative and cognitive barriers that prevent an organization from sharing data in the study setting.
\item \textit{Business goals}: to understand the motivation of participating companies to take part in the collaboration. 
\item \textit{Data quality}: to understand the state of the companys data and their perception on the importance, possibilities and risks of its quality. 
\item \textit{Data lifecycle management}: to determine how companies understand the process of data flows.
\item \textit{Data security and access management}: to determine the importance, requirements and current state of the topic. 
\item \textit{Data ownership and governance}: to understand what concerns and constraints the companies have towards ownership of the data.
\item \textit{Business models}: to understand when companies would consider applying shared data models.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Case Study}
Case study is a way to collect data through observation and to test theories in an unmodified setting. The linkage with empirical evidence makes case study research likely to have strengths such as novelty, testability and empirical validity \cite{eisenhardt1989building}. Case studies can be divided into four different purposes: Exploratory, Descriptive, Explanatory and Improving \cite{robson2016real}. An exploratory case study seeks new insights, finds out what is happening, and generates ideas and hypotheses for new research. Descriptive case study attempts to portray a situation or a phenomenom. An explanatory case study attempts to seek an explanation to a problem or a situation, mostly in a causal relationship. Finally, an improving case study tries to improve an aspect of the studied phenomenom.

Different approaches to the order of data collection, analysis and generalization can be categorized into inductive, deductive and abductive approaches \cite{dubois2002systematic}. An inductive approach moves from data to theory, and begins by first collecting the data, and then looking for patterns and forming theories that explain those patterns. A deductive approach is in reverse order. An abductive approach starts with the consideration of facts or particular observations, which are then used to form hypotheses that relate them to a fact or a rule that accounts for them. The facts are therefore correlated into a more general description, that relates them to a wider context.

\subsubsection{Data analysis}

Data analysis is based on template analysis, which is a way to thematically organize and analyze qualitative data \cite{king1998template}.
