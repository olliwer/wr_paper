Business model
==============

typical: 
physical goods -> transfer ownership through sales
owner responsible for costs of servicing and use, has risks of downtime and defects not incldued in warranty

possible alteration:
"product-as-a-service"
manufacturer, through collecting data, can optimize service and predict and reduce failures. customers can pay as they use the product, not up-front. manufacturer captures service efficiencies.
-> increased buyer power, if buyers can easily change products




Digital maturity
================

In essence, an organization where digital has transformed processes, talent engagement and business models
